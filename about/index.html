	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Calderwood!</h1>
	<p>I'm a new Masters Student at UC Davis in the Hydrologic Sciences Grad Group with Graham Fogg and Laura Foglia as my advisors.
        I plan to investigate groundwater and surface water interactions in the Cosumnes River Basin. I previously earned my B.S. in
        Civil and Environmental Engineering from UC Davis in June 2019 with an emphasis in Water Resources. </p>
	
	<h1> Quick History </h1>
		<p> I grew up on the Central Coast of California in Los Osos, a small town right off the ocean and surrounded by tons of fantastic 
		hiking and nature. While growing up (and still today) I worked for my dad who is a general contractor and I enjoyed 
		working with my hands and learning the details of proper construction. I transfered my interest in construction to my studies
		when I began as Civil and Environmental Engineering student at UC Davis in 2015. Throughout my four years at Davis my
		interest shifted from general construction to geotechnical to water resources as I learned about the need for 
		computer modeling and field data collection in these uncertain fields. During my 3rd and 4th years at UC Davis I completed floodplain
		groundwater data collection and management, along with basic data analysis in R for Amy Yoder and Graham Fogg. 
		Now I have combined my interests to continue my studies in groundwater and surface water interactions. </p>
	
	<h1> Parks and Rec (Free Time!) </h1>
		<p> In my free time I enjoy climbing with friends at the local rock gym during the week or outside on the weekends.
		I'm also an active backpacker and my go to spot the past few years has been Desolation Wilderness for short weekend trips.
		On a more relaxed day, I read historical novelss or walk around the farmers market with friends. I lead an eight grade boys
		bible study at my local church once a week where I organize active games and a quieter bible time. My 3rd and 4th year at UC Davis
		I led a college student bible study where I facilitated group conversations, times of prayer, and reading every Thursday. </p>
