Woohoo, I saw [Rich Pauloo's neat github website](https://richpauloo.github.io/) and decided to make my own
following advice from [Jonathan McGlone's site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It uses 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which allows creating a default layout and converts Markdown to html. I understand html
and css a little bit more now, but it is still more complicated than markdown.
