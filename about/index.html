	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Calderwood!</h1>
	<p>I'm a new Masters Student at UC Davis in the Hydrologic Sciences Grad Group with Graham Fogg and Laura Foglia as my advisors.
        I plan to investigate groundwater and surface water interactions in the Cosumnes River Basin. I previously earned my B.S. in
        Civil and Environmental Engineering from UC Davis in June 2019 with an emphasis in Water Resources. <p>
	
	<h1> Parks and Rec (Free Time!) </h1>
		<p> In my free time I enjoy climbing with friends at the local rock gym during the week or outside on the weekends.
		I'm also an active backpacker and my go to spot the past few years has been Desolation Wilderness for short weekend trips.
		On a more relaxed day, I read historical novelss or walk around the farmers market with friends. I lead an eight grade boys
		bible study at my local church once a week where I organize active games and a quieter bible time. <p>
