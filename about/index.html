	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Calderwood!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Project Engineer at Larry Walker Associates (LWA) working in the Groundwater and Water Resources fields. At (LWA) I support a variety
	of projects focused on sustainable groundwater management where my duties include project coordination, hydrologic conditions monitoring, data management,
	 groundwater flow modeling, scenario analyses, and annual reporting support to meet regulatory requirements.
	I earned my Ph.D. in Physical Hydrology from the Hydrologic Sciences Gradudate Group at UC Davis in March 2024, with Helen Dahlke and Laura Foglia as my advisors.
	My graudate research explored groundwater and surface water interactions in the Cosumnes River Basin. I previously earned my B.S. in
	Civil and Environmental Engineering from UC Davis in June 2019 with an emphasis in Water Resources. </p>
	
	<h1> Work and Research </h1>
	<p>Andrew Calderwood is a Project Engineer with LWA and has three years of experience in groundwater and one year of experience
	in the environmental consulting field. Mr. Calderwood holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering from
	the University of California Davis and is completing his doctoral studies at UC Davis in Physical Hydrology with a focus on 
	surface-water groundwater interactions to aid regional and local water resources management. His Ph.D. studies combined field 
	data collection on the local and regional scale with multiple types of numerical groundwater-surface water modeling to advance
	the field of surface-water groundwater characterization while analyzing the benefit of management actions to improve local 
	groundwater-surface water conditions. He has experience in groundwater investigations, surface water quality and hydraulics 
	modeling, and groundwater modeling. Since joining LWA in 2020 he has been integral to technical work associated with Groundwater
	Sustainability Plans (GSPs) within Siskiyou County, California. He is responsible for engaging a multi-stakeholder client, which 
	comprises a watershed-scale integrated hydrogeologic model development, future scenario generation and climate change assessment, 
	management action design under uncertainty, and preparation of the draft GSP. He also assists water resources clients with recharge 
	permit application and reporting, along with field study, data cleaning and analysis for recharge benefit analysis. </p>
	
	<h1> Background </h1>
	<p> I grew up on the Central Coast of California in Los Osos, a small town right off the ocean and surrounded by tons of fantastic 
	hiking and nature. While growing up (and still today) I worked for my dad who is a general contractor and I enjoyed 
	working with my hands and learning the details of proper construction. I transfered my interest in construction to my studies
	when I began as Civil and Environmental Engineering student at UC Davis in 2015. Throughout my four years at Davis my
	interest shifted from general construction to geotechnical to water resources as I learned about the need for 
	computer modeling and field data collection in these uncertain fields. During my 3rd and 4th years at UC Davis I completed floodplain
	groundwater data collection and management, along with basic data analysis in R for Amy Yoder and Graham Fogg. 
	Ultimately I combined my interests to continue my studies in groundwater and surface water interactions. </p>
	
	<h1> Parks and Rec (Free Time!) </h1>
	<p> In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and family outdoors whether it is hiking, cycling, or walking on the beach. 
	Before graduate school my wife and I were active backpackers and our go to spot was Desolation Wilderness for short weekend trips.
	Now that we are finished with school we are looking to explore more hiking trails on the Central Coast and travel to the Sierra Nevada
	mountain range for short backpacking trips.
	On a more relaxed day, I read historical novels or walk around the farmers market with family.  </p>
