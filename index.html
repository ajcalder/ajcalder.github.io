	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Calderwood!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Project Engineer at Larry Walker Associates (LWA) working in the Groundwater and Water Resources fields. At (LWA) I support a variety
	of projects focused on sustainable groundwater management where my duties include project coordination, hydrologic conditions monitoring, data management,
	 groundwater flow modeling, scenario analyses, and annual reporting support to meet regulatory requirements.
	I earned my Ph.D. in Physical Hydrology from the Hydrologic Sciences Gradudate Group at UC Davis in March 2024, with Helen Dahlke and Laura Foglia as my advisors.
	My graudate research explored groundwater and surface water interactions in the Cosumnes River Basin. I previously earned my B.S. in
	Civil and Environmental Engineering from UC Davis in June 2019 with an emphasis in Water Resources.
