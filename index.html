	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Calderwood!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at UC Davis in the Hydrologic Sciences Grad Group with Helen Dahlke and Laura Foglia as my advisors.
        I investigate groundwater and surface water interactions in the Cosumnes River Basin. I previously earned my B.S. in
        Civil and Environmental Engineering from UC Davis in June 2019 with an emphasis in Water Resources.
